            <p>The Zoo is a free, family-focused zoo which has a small range of exotic and domestic animals and<br>
            is recognised as one of the most progressive zoos in the<br>
            world. There is lots to see and do all year, including events, eye-to-eye<br>
            encounters, behind the scenes tours and more!</p>

            <P>Zoo experiences motivate children to care for the enviroment and this is<br>
            especially important as they will be the caretakers of our precious<br>
            biodiversity in the future.</P>

            <p>The Zoo was started in 1965 by two very dedicated conservationists, and<br>
            since that time we have been creating animal exhibits that not only emulate<br>
            the animals' natural habitats but also provide spectators and visitors with<br>
            excellent views of both the outdoor areas and the sleeping quarters.</p>

            <p><strong>Hours: </strong>We are open 9am to 5pm every day.<br>
            We are open all public holidays including Christmas Day. </p>

            <p><strong>Facilities:</strong> Wheelchair and pushchair access,<br>
                playground, sun shade, toilets and picnic tables.</p>

            <p>The Zoo is a member of the International Zoo Educators Association
